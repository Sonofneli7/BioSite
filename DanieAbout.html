    The year is 1998 and the day is June 21st, Steven and Deborah Carr welcome the birth of their second child. 
    Two years earlier they were blessed the birth of Danielle’s, Danie for short, older brother Matthew. 
    They grew up in the outskirts of Foxboro, Massachusetts, in a small, yet lively town, called Norfolk. 
    To give you better perspective, the town is a 10-minute drive Northwest of the famous Gillette Stadium, 
    home to the NFL’s New England Patriots. Danie’s father, a Public Account, owns his own business, and 
    mother, is personal secretary to Norfolk’s Police sheriff, ran a respectable and loving household.
    Danie excelled in multiple sports throughout her adolescence and considers herself more of a “Tom Boy”
    a “Barbie Doll” type female. Throughout her upbringing she developed a close relationship with her 
    father due to their mutual love within sport. Because of this love, Danie’s father would be her 
    brothers’ and her sports coach for most of their youth years. Danie took this passion for playing s
    ports into other parts of her live. She thrived off the competitive nature and the feeling of excelling. 
    This drive for purity and excellence sparked an enjoyment in imagery and discovery. Danie at one time 
    within her high school career even want to go into Criminal Profiling. Life had a different journey 
    though; a tour of a neighboring high school gave her access to witness a young lady constructing a 
    Bird of Paradise design out of apple. At that moment, she fell in love with the creativity and art 
    involved in the undertaking and a career among Law Enforcement was only a thought. After High School 
    Danie went to Johnson and Wales, one of two top colleges known for Pastry Arts on a partial 
    scholarship, to receive her bachelor’s degree. Though she had a full scholarship to venture into 
    the Law, the Pastry World won out. She then stared out her next career journey. The quest brought 
    her to a paid internship her last year of college with Walt Disney World, in Central Florida. She c
    ompleted a 6-month program and sought to return in which ever way she could. That way was to apply 
    for another program though she had already graduated and by the blessing eventually led to a full-time 
    position. Danie worked her way and reputation from a position at the Boardwalk resort to eventually, 
    the infamous, Grand Floridian resort. There, she worked under the tutelage of Party Arts Director and 
    Executive Head Chef, Erich Erbicheck. Through dealing with life-long dietary restrictions Danie has s
    till solved her way to reaching the next level of the Pastry World at it’s Sous Chef Position and known 
    to be one of  the youngest to reach that position at Walt Disney World. This love for the art propels 
    her to the continue feeling of having someone try her desert and stating, “I can’t get enough of this,
     it tastes so good!” Ultimately her goal is to one day rise to level of Head Pastry Chef for one of 
     newest, innovative, resort openings that happen around the Walt Disney World Property.
